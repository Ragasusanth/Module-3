# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
my_tuple = eval(input())
is_n_not_exists = 'n' not in my_tuple
is_8_exists = '8' in my_tuple
print(is_n_not_exists)
print(is_8_exists)
```

## Output

## Result

This program correctly uses the in operator to check for the presence of both a string and a number in a tuple.
